Story with Rebecca Hersher, Tegan Wendland (WWNO), Steven Newborn (WUSF) and Daniel Rivero (WLRN)<br>

NPR obtained HUD real estate owned properties sales records from January 2017 to August 2020 through a Freedom of Information Act request. NPR cross referenced the records with FEMAâ€™s flood maps to identify homes in special flood hazard areas - [here's the Jupyter Notebook detailing how](https://github.com/ NPR-investigations /HUD_homes_in_SFHAs/blob/main/20210809_HUD_RH_geocoding_for_sharing.ipynb). NPR downloaded FEMA's flood maps in August 2020. <br> 

NPR also cross referenced the records with American Community Survey data to analyze neighborhood characteristics of these homes. This involves identifying the census tracts of homes - [here's the notebook for the process](https://github.com/ NPR-investigations/HUD_homes_in_SFHAs/blob/main/20210811_HUD_RH_geocode_census_tracts.ipynb) and [here's NPR's analysis on neigorhood characteristics of HUD homes in SFHAs](https://github.com/NPR-investigations/HUD_homes_in_SFHAs/blob/main/20210729_HUD_RH_SFHA_analysis_for_sharing.ipynb)
